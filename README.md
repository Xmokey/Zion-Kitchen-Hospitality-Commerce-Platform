## Overview

Zion Kitchen is a Nigerian restaurant operating two branches (Washington DC and Laurel, Maryland), offering West African cuisine and curated cultural dining experiences.

To support recurring revenue, digital ordering, and operational coordination, we delivered a **subscription-enabled commerce platform** integrating:

- Tiered membership access (Free, Elite, Royal)
- Gated member-only benefits and pricing logic
- Multi-channel ordering (pickup, onsite dining, third-party delivery)
- Marketplace integrations (DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc via TryOtter)
- Structured meal-pack commerce (7, 14, 30-day bundles)
- Event catering and lounge rental booking
- Centralized administrative control panel

This repository documents delivery oversight and system design execution.  
No proprietary source code is included.
